# House-Prediction
This a predictive model that predicts the prices of houses based on geographical location and other factors.
A house value is simply more than location and square footage. Like the features that make up a person, the buyer would want to know all aspects that give a house its value.
We are going to take advantage of all of the feature variables available to use and use it to analyze and predict house prices.
In this we firstly clean the data set removing not relevant features from the data set and then applying algorithm to predict the price of house in a particular location.
